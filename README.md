# Business-Strategy-Project
This is a Business Strategy project that I had completed as an academic project while I was doing my MSc in Business Management (Business Strategy and Marketing) at The University of Hull. 
We were given some data and statistics revolving a company called Dog Pool and we were told to write a business plan to grow this business. I have mentioned the reccomendations I came up with
after analysing the data and information provided to us in the last section of this Strategy report.
